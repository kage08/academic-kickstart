title: "Integrating Lexical Knowledge in Word Embeddings using Sprinkling and Retrofitting"
subtitle: ""
summary: "We take advantage of Levy et al's work which showed that using SVD based methods on co-occurrence matrix provide similar performance to neural network based embeddings. We propose a 'sprinkling' technique to add semantic relations to the co-occurrence matrix directly before factorization. In the second approach, WordNet similarity scores are used to improve the retrofitting method. We evaluate the proposed methods in both intrinsic and extrinsic tasks and observe significant improvements over the baselines in many of the datasets. "
